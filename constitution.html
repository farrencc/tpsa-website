        <p>The Theoretical Physics Student Association (TPSA) of Ireland was founded in 2019 by Michael Mitchell, alongside a group of dedicated students from Trinity College Dublin (TCD). While pursuing their studies in Theoretical Physics, these forward-thinking individuals identified a significant gap in their overall development as emerging professionals. They envisioned and established a space where students could collaborate and hone their social, problem-solving, and explanatory skills, thus filling this gap and enhancing their professional growth.</p>

        <p>Driven by a passion for excellence and a desire to make a substantial impact, the founders also aimed to elevate Ireland's standing in the global physics community. They believed that through their collective efforts, they could contribute to placing Ireland on the map of physics excellence.</p>

        <p>Since its inception, the TPSA has achieved notable milestones. It has played a pivotal role in advancing Ireland's involvement with CERN thereby integrating Ireland more deeply into the global physics research community. Moreover, the TPSA has collaborated with state branches to support and uphold democratic processes, demonstrating a commitment to civic engagement and societal betterment as well as a keenness to work with experts outside of theoretical physics.</p>

        <p>This particular endeavor led to the creation of a sister organization, The Problem Solving Association CLG. This non-profit entity is dedicated to providing members with opportunities to apply their unique skillsets for the benefit of society. Embracing a philosophy of open-source collaboration, this organization underscores the TPSA's commitment to utilizing theoretical physics and problem-solving skills for the greater good.</p>

        <h3 class="blue-center">2.2 Turnover and Committee Modification</h3>

        <h4 class="blue-center">2.2.1. Termination Protocol</h4>

        <p>1. A vote of no confidence can be invoked as long as two-thirds (2/3) of the committee is present at the vote.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">a) It will be passed if the majority vote in favour.</p>

        <p>2. If a vote of no confidence is invoked, then the redistribution protocol must be followed for that role.</p>

        <p>3. The vote of no confidence will instigate the termination protocol:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">a) Notice of accusation.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">b) Minimum wait of one week.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">c) Then the vote of termination will occur at the next meeting.</p>

        <p>4. If a committee member feels unsafe around another committee member (executive or non-executive), they may write to either:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">a) Another executive committee member.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">b) If they do not feel like they can contact another committee member, then they should contact founder Michael A.J. Mitchell, or someone on the list of Arbitrators appointed by Michael.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;">1) A committee member cannot simultaneously be an arbitrator.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">c) If Michael is not available, it will go to the most senior Arbitrator. That person will decide whether a vote of termination will occur, with or without the person. If they agree to the vote of termination, then the vote will occur with or without the accused committee member in question.</p>

        <p>5. The vote of termination will occur as follows:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">a) In order for a non-executive member to be voted out, two-thirds (2/3) of committee votes are needed plus at least one executive committee member vote.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">b) In order for an executive member to be voted out, two-thirds (2/3) of committee votes are needed plus both other executive member votes.</p>

        <p>6. Votes are not anonymous and will take place during meetings.</p>

        <h4 class="blue-center">2.2.2. Committee Turnover</h4>

        <p>1. Following the AGM, the turnover protocol begins.</p>

        <p>2. The old committee will keep their duties until the start of the following academic year. At that point, the new committee will take over.</p>

        <p>3. Information for the committee handover for the respective roles is detailed on the notion.</p>

        <p>4. Furthermore, in the case of new members for a role, the old member for that position must ensure that the new member is able to take over the role efficiently.</p>

        <h4 class="blue-center">2.2.3. Capacity to Make New Positions</h4>

        <p><strong>1. Protocol for Making New Positions</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">a) The proposal for a new position must be submitted in writing to the executive committee.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">b) The proposal must include the rationale for the new position, a detailed description of the role, and its necessity for the TPSA.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">c) The executive committee will review the proposal and, if deemed appropriate, present it to the full committee for a vote.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">d) A new position will be created if it receives a majority vote in favour by the committee.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Maximum Number of Positions/Temporary Positions</strong></p>

        <p><strong>1. Fundamental Prerequisites to Committee Membership</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">a) A prospective committee member must be a member of the TPSA before the time of the election.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">b) In the case of suspected foul play, either seen in the past or the potential seen ahead, the committee may instate a mandatory minimum time as a member before being able to run for</p>

        <p><strong>2. Voting System</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">a) If only one person is running for a position, a vote must still be held. If the candidate does not receive a majority vote, the role will be reopened for election at the EGM. If still no one is instated, the role is redistributed through the committee until a replacement is found.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">b) Only the Secretary can see votes for all other elections, except the vote for the Secretary if they are rerunning. In this case, the votes are handled by the committee member with the most experience.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">c) Voters are elements of the electorate, which are a subset of the member list, valid until:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;">1) Two weeks before the AGM.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 4em;">2) By the scheduled time for the EGM.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">d) If RON (Re-Open Nominations) wins any votes, or if no one runs for a position, the vote is rerun without the additional caveats as mentioned in 2a.ii.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Order of Voting</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">a) A time limit will be set for speeches by candidates.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Times for Voting</strong></p>

        <p><strong>5. Procedure for When a Committee Member Cannot Perform Their Role Before the Committee Handover</strong></p>
        <p style="margin-left: 2em;">a) If a committee member cannot perform their role before the committee handover, the executive committee will appoint an interim replacement. The procedure will depend on the timing of the vacancy and the specific circumstances involved.</p>
